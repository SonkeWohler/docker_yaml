This ties the [backend](https://github.com/SonkeWohler/backend) and
[frontend](https://github.com/SonkeWohler/frontend) for my docker experiments
together via a simple `docker-compose.yaml` setup.

There is also an [alternative
implementation](https://github.com/SonkeWohler/docker_parent) of this using git
submodules and bash scripts that I really shouldn't have spent any time on, but
it was fun nonetheless.

## Running

Simply use `docker-compose up`, in whatever tool you use to manage docker.
